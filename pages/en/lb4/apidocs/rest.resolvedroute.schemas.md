## ResolvedRoute.schemas property

Server/application wide schemas shared by multiple routes, e.g. model schemas. This is a temporary workaround for missing support for $ref references, see https://github.com/loopbackio/loopback-next/issues/435

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly schemas: SchemasObject;
```
