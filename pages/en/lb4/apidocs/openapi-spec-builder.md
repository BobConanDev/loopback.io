## openapi-spec-builder package

A package to simplify creating OpenAPI specification documents in your tests using the builder pattern.

## Remarks

Creating a full OpenAPI spec document in automated tests is rather cumbersome, long JSON-like objects pollute the test test code and make it difficult for readers to distinguish between what's important in the test and what's just shared OpenAPI boilerplate.

OpenApiSpecBuilder utilizes [Test Data Builder pattern](http://www.natpryce.com/articles/000714.html) to provide a TypeScript/JavaScript API allowing users to create full OpenAPI Specification 3 documents in few lines of code.
