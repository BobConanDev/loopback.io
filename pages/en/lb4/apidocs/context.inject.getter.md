## inject.getter variable

Inject a function for getting the actual bound value.

This is useful when implementing Actions, where the action is instantiated for Sequence constructor, but some of action's dependencies become bound only after other actions have been executed by the sequence.

See also `Getter<T>`<!-- -->.

**Signature:**

```typescript
getter: (bindingSelector: BindingSelector<unknown>, metadata?: InjectionMetadata) => (target: Object, member: string | undefined, methodDescriptorOrParameterIndex?: number | TypedPropertyDescriptor<any> | undefined) => void
```
