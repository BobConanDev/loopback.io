## Application.start() method

Start the application, and all of its registered observers. The application state is checked to ensure the integrity of `start`<!-- -->.

If the application is not initialized, it calls first `init()` to initialize the application. This only happens if `start()` is called for the first time.

If the application is already started, no operation is performed.

**Signature:**

```typescript
start(): Promise<void>;
```
**Returns:**

Promise&lt;void&gt;
