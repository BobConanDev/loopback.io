## DefaultCrudRepository.execute() method

Execute a raw database command using a connector that's not described by LoopBack's `execute` API yet.

\*\*WARNING:\*\* In general, it is always better to perform database actions through repository methods. Directly executing database commands may lead to unexpected results and other issues.

**Signature:**

```typescript
execute(...args: PositionalParameters): Promise<AnyObject>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  args | [PositionalParameters](./repository.positionalparameters.md) | Command and parameters, please consult your connector's documentation to learn about supported commands and their parameters. |

**Returns:**

Promise&lt;[AnyObject](./repository.anyobject.md)<!-- -->&gt;

A promise which resolves to the command output as returned by the database driver.
