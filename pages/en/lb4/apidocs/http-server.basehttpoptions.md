Its value is the number of milliseconds to wait before in-flight requests finish when the server is being stopped. With this setting, we also reject new requests from existing keep-alive connections in addition to stopping accepting new connections.</p><p>Defaults to Infinity (don't force-close). If you want to immediately destroy all sockets set its value to <code>0</code>.</p><p>See [stoppable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stoppable)</p> |
