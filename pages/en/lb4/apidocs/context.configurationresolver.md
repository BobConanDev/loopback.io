## ConfigurationResolver interface

Resolver for configuration of bindings. It's responsible for finding corresponding configuration for a given binding key.

By default, `undefined` is expected if no configuration is provided. The behavior can be overridden by setting `optional` to `false` in resolution options.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export interface ConfigurationResolver 
```
