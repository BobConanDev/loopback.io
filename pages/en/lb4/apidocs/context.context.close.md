## Context.close() method

Close the context: clear observers, stop notifications, and remove event listeners from its parent context.

**Signature:**

```typescript
close(): void;
```
**Returns:**

void

## Remarks

This method MUST be called to avoid memory leaks once a context object is no longer needed and should be recycled. An example is the `RequestContext`<!-- -->, which is created per request.
