## PoolingService class

A singleton service to maintain a pool of resources. This pool service can be bound to different keys to represent multiple pools. Each binding is a singleton so that the state stays the same for injections into multiple instances for other artifacts.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare class PoolingService<T> implements LifeCycleObserver 
```
**Implements:** [LifeCycleObserver](./core.lifecycleobserver.md)

## Remarks

Some resources can be expensive to create/start. For example, a datasource has overhead to connect to the database. There will be performance penalty to use `TRANSIENT` scope and creates a new instance per request. But it is not feasible to be a singleton for some use cases, for example, each request may have different security contexts.

The pool service observes life cycle events to start and stop.
